           <h6 id="privacy">PRIVACY POLICY</h6>
           <h7>We Respect Your Privacy</h7>
           <p class="pad">We provide this notice explaining our online information practices. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. By visiting this website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. </p>
           <h7>Information We Collect</h7><br>
           <h7 class="pad">Two types of information are collected:</h7>
           <p class="pad">1. Personal, or "individually identifiable," information you provide to us; and 2. Standard web server/visitor traffic information, commonly referred to as "aggregate information," regarding overall website traffic patterns. Normally, web servers collect this type of basic information as part of their web log processes. We do not report on individual user sessions.</p>
           <p>While processing your visit to our site, there are instances when NFCWP collects individually identifiable information in order to better facilitate the purpose of your visit. For example if you wish to donate to NFCWP or any of its programs, we will collect information such as your first and last name, street address, city, state, zip code, telephone number, email address, and credit card information. We process this information via a secure, encrypted SSL session. SSL is the proven standard for secure web messaging transactions. We maintain records of all financial transactions in a secure location accessible only by authorized staff. Standard credit card information (card number, card type, expiration date) is discarded from our server after the transaction is complete. </p>
           <h6>How do we use the information?</h6>
           <p class="pad">Occasionally, NFCWP may contact individuals who have provided their individually identifiable information through the website in order to supply you with news and information. We aggregate unlinked personal information and use it to: </p>
           <ul>
             <li>Improve our marketing and promotional efforts</li>
             <li> Statistically analyze site usage</li>
             <li>Improve our content and offerings</li>
             <li>Customize our site's content and layout</li>
           </ul>
           <p>This enables us to improve our site and tailor it to better meet our users' needs. In these situations, however, we remove any ties to information that could be used to personally identify you. <br>
If you wish to restrict the use of your contact information, you may let us know by: <br><br>
Emailing NFCWP from our website. Use the "contact us" link (this is usually found on the bottom of each NFCWP web page). </p>
           <h6>USE OF COOKIES</h6>
           <p style="padding-bottom:40px;">Certain sections of the NFCWP website use "cookies" to store user information. A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer viruses, or capture your email address. Cookies help us understand which parts of our website are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how much time they spend there. We use cookies to analyze patterns so we can improve the site. You have the ability to accept or not accept "cookies."</p>
